description: Connect VM0 agents to Slack and chat with them in any channel
---

The VM0 Slack integration brings your agents directly into Slack. Once connected, you can mention `@VM0` in any channel or send a direct message to interact with your agents through natural conversation.

## Use Cases

- **Team Q&A** — Connect a knowledge-base agent and let anyone in the channel ask questions
- **Automated workflows** — Trigger agent tasks from Slack conversations without switching to the terminal
- **Collaborative debugging** — Share context in a thread and let the agent help investigate
- **Parallel task execution** — Kick off agent tasks in Slack while you continue other work

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| VM0 Account | Sign up at [vm0.ai](https://www.vm0.ai) if you don't have one |
| Slack Workspace | Admin access to [install the VM0 app](https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=9860643978390.10448672115104&scope=app_mentions:read,channels:history,channels:read,chat:write,commands,groups:history,im:history,im:write,reactions:write,users:read&user_scope=) in your workspace |

## Setup

### 1. Install the VM0 App in Slack

A workspace administrator must [install the VM0 app](https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=9860643978390.10448672115104&scope=app_mentions:read,channels:history,channels:read,chat:write,commands,groups:history,im:history,im:write,reactions:write,users:read&user_scope=) to the workspace. During installation, Slack will ask you to authorize the following permissions:

- Read messages in channels and DMs where VM0 is added
- Send messages and reactions
- Handle slash commands
- Read user information and shared files

### 2. Connect Your VM0 Account

After the app is installed, connect your VM0 account to Slack. You can do this either by running the slash command in any channel where VM0 is present:

```
/vm0 connect
```

Or by opening the VM0 App Home in Slack and clicking the **Connect** button.

Both options open a browser flow where you sign in to your VM0 account. During the connect flow:

1. If no model provider is configured, you'll be prompted to set one up first (e.g. an Anthropic API key).
2. The workspace admin can select which agent to use for the workspace. Non-admin users see the workspace's default agent.
3. Click **Authorize** to complete the connection.

Once connected, the selected agent is available to everyone in any channel where `@VM0` is present.

<Callout type="info">
The workspace admin can change the workspace agent at any time via `/vm0 settings` or from the [Settings](/docs/integrations/slack#settings) page on the VM0 Platform.
</Callout>

## How It Works

### Mention in Channels

Mention `@VM0` in any channel with your message.

```
@VM0 summarize the latest support tickets
```

A thinking reaction appears while the agent processes your request.

### Direct Messages

You can also DM the VM0 bot directly for private, one-on-one interactions. In DMs, all messages are routed to your agent automatically.

### Thread Context

When you mention `@VM0` in a thread, it gathers context from all messages in that thread. This lets the agent understand the full conversation and provide more relevant responses.

## Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/vm0 connect` | Connect your Slack account to VM0 |
| `/vm0 disconnect` | Disconnect your VM0 account |
| `/vm0 settings` | Open the VM0 Platform to configure secrets, variables, and the workspace agent |
| `/vm0 help` | Show available commands |

## App Home

The App Home tab in Slack shows your connection status, the workspace agent, and quick-reference commands. Open it by clicking "VM0" in your Slack Apps section.

## Settings

Use `/vm0 settings` to open the VM0 Platform settings page where you can:

- Configure secrets and environment variables for your agent
- Select or change the workspace agent (admin only)

## Troubleshooting

### Agent not responding

1. Verify your VM0 account is connected — run `/vm0 connect`
2. Check that a model provider is configured — you'll be prompted during connect if one is missing

### Authentication errors

1. Run `/vm0 disconnect` then `/vm0 connect` to reconnect your account
2. Verify your VM0 account is active
