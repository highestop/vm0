## Installation

Install the VM0 CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @vm0/cli
```

Or use your preferred package manager: `pnpm add -g @vm0/cli` / `yarn global add @vm0/cli`

## Login

Authenticate with your VM0 account:

```bash
vm0 auth login
```

## Set Up Model Provider

Configure your model provider credentials (one-time setup):

```bash
vm0 model-provider setup
```

This interactive command will prompt you to select a provider and enter your credentials. The credentials are stored securely on VM0's servers and automatically used in all your agent runs.

For other model providers like Anthropic API, OpenAI, or third-party providers, see [Model Selection](/docs/model-selection).

## Create Your First Agent

Create a new directory and initialize a VM0 agent:

```bash
mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
vm0 init
```

This creates two files:

- **[vm0.yaml](/docs/reference/vm0-yaml)** - Agent configuration file that defines the agent's provider and environment settings
- **AGENTS.md** - Instructions file that describes what the agent should do and how it should behave

## Run Your Agent

Start the agent with a prompt:

```bash
vm0 cook "let's start working."
```

The `cook` command is a complete workflow that:
1. Prepares artifacts from your local files
2. Composes the agent using [`vm0.yaml`](/docs/reference/configuration/vm0-yaml) and [`AGENTS.md`](/docs/core-concept/instructions)
3. Executes the agent with your prompt

This command displays the agent's execution logs in real-time. When the agent finishes, any files it created or modified will be downloaded to the `artifact` directory in your project.
