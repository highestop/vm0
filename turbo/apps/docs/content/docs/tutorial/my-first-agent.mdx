title: My First Agent
description: Set up and run your first agent in 5 minutes
---

In this guide, you'll create your first VM0 agent, configure it, and run it to see how agents work.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- VM0 CLI installed (`npm install -g @vm0/cli`)
- Authenticated with VM0 (`vm0 auth login`)
- Model provider configured (`vm0 model-provider setup`) - see [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) if you haven't done this yet

## Step 1: Create Your Project

Create a new directory for your research agent:

```bash
mkdir research-agent
cd research-agent
```

## Step 2: Initialize Your Agent

Initialize a new VM0 agent project with a descriptive name:

```bash
vm0 init -n my-researcher
```

This command creates two important files:

- **vm0.yaml** - Agent configuration file that defines provider, image, and environment settings
- **AGENTS.md** - Instructions file that describes what your agent should do

Let's look at what was created:

```yaml title="vm0.yaml"
version: "1.0"

agents:
  my-researcher:
    framework: claude-code
    # Build agentic workflow using natural language
    instructions: AGENTS.md
```

```markdown title="AGENTS.md"
# Agent Instructions

You are a HackerNews AI content curator.

## Workflow

1. Go to HackerNews and read the top 10 articles
2. Find and extract AI-related content from these articles
3. Summarize the findings into a X (Twitter) post format
4. Write the summary to content.md
```

The `vm0.yaml` file includes helpful comments showing you where to add skills. The `AGENTS.md` file provides a complete example workflow that you can study and customize. We'll modify this in the next part of the tutorial to build our research agent.

## Step 3: Run Your First Agent

Now let's run your agent and watch it complete the workflow:

```bash
vm0 cook "let's do it"
```

You'll see output similar to this:

```
Reading config: vm0.yaml
✓ Config validated: 1 agent, 0 volume(s)

Processing artifact:
> mkdir artifact
> cd artifact
> vm0 artifact init --name artifact
> vm0 artifact push
> cd ..

Composing agent:
> vm0 compose vm0.yaml
Uploading instructions: AGENTS.md
✓ Instructions (unchanged): b2d77a3d
Uploading compose...
✓ Compose version exists: your-username/my-researcher
  Version: e2ec8e50

Running agent:
> vm0 run my-researcher --artifact-name artifact "let's do it"

cat artifact/content.md
# You'll see the AI content summary!
```

If you see `artifact/content.md` created with HackerNews AI content, congratulations! Your agent is working correctly.

## What Just Happened?

`vm0 cook` is a convenient command that runs multiple steps automatically. Here's what it did:

### 1. Prepared Artifact Directory
```bash
mkdir artifact
cd artifact
vm0 artifact init --name artifact
vm0 artifact push
cd ..
```
This creates a workspace where your agent can save output files. The artifact directory is synced between your local machine and the remote agent.

See [Artifact](/docs/core-concept/artifact) for more information about managing agent output.

### 2. Composed Agent
```bash
vm0 compose vm0.yaml
```
This step binds your [instructions](/docs/core-concept/instructions) and [skills](/docs/core-concept/skills) together to compose your agent.

### 3. Ran Agent
```bash
vm0 run my-researcher --artifact-name artifact "let's do it"
```
This step creates a remote sandbox environment and executes your prompt using Claude Code with your configured instructions and skills, streaming real-time logs back to you.

In this step, Claude Code follows your prompt "let's do it" along with the instructions in `AGENTS.md` to complete the workflow: fetching content from HackerNews, extracting AI-related articles, and generating the X (Twitter) post summary.

### 4. Downloaded Results
```bash
cd artifact && vm0 artifact pull <artifact-version> && cd ..
```
Any files the agent created or modified are downloaded to your local `artifact` directory.

## Understanding Your Project Structure

After this step, your project should look like this:

```
research-agent/
├── vm0.yaml       # Agent configuration
├── AGENTS.md      # Agent instructions (system prompt)
└── artifact/      # Output files from agent runs
    └── content.md # HackerNews AI summary created by agent
```
