title: Scheduling Your Agent
description: Run your research agent automatically on a schedule
---

Now let's set up your research agent to run automatically on a schedule. VM0 provides a built-in scheduling system that lets you run agents at specific times without any external infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

You should have completed the previous sections of this tutorial and have a working research agent with Firecrawl and Tavily skills configured.

## Step 1: Compose Your Agent

First, make sure your agent is composed and ready:

```bash
vm0 compose vm0.yaml
```

This ensures your latest agent configuration is uploaded to VM0.

## Step 2: Set Up a Schedule

Use the `vm0 schedule setup` command to create a schedule for your agent:

```bash
vm0 schedule setup my-researcher
```

This interactive command will guide you through the setup process:

```
Creating new schedule for agent my-researcher

? Schedule frequency › Daily
? Time (HH:MM) › 09:00
? Timezone › America/Los_Angeles
? Prompt to run › research the latest AI news and developments
```

After completing the prompts, you'll see a confirmation:

```
Deploying schedule for agent my-researcher...
✓ Created schedule for agent my-researcher
  Timezone: America/Los_Angeles
  Cron: 0 9 * * *

  To activate: vm0 schedule enable my-researcher
```

## Step 3: Enable the Schedule

Schedules are created in a disabled state by default. To activate your schedule, run:

```bash
vm0 schedule enable my-researcher
```

You'll see:

```
✓ Enabled schedule for agent my-researcher
```

Your agent is now scheduled to run daily at 9:00 AM!

## What Just Happened?

You configured VM0's built-in scheduler to run your agent automatically. The scheduler:

1. Stores your schedule configuration on VM0's servers
2. Waits for you to enable it (schedules start disabled for safety)
3. Triggers agent runs at the specified times
4. Uses your configured secrets and variables
5. Saves output to the artifact directory

No external infrastructure like GitHub Actions or cron servers is needed - VM0 handles everything.

## Managing Your Schedule

You can view and control your schedules with these commands:

```bash
# View all your schedules
vm0 schedule list

# Check status of a specific schedule
vm0 schedule status my-researcher

# Pause a schedule temporarily
vm0 schedule disable my-researcher

# Resume a paused schedule
vm0 schedule enable my-researcher

# Remove a schedule completely
vm0 schedule delete my-researcher
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've completed the tutorial series. Your research agent can now:

- Gather information from multiple sources using Tavily
- Extract clean content using Firecrawl
- Create comprehensive research reports
- Run automatically on a schedule

From here, you can:

- Visit [Model Selection](/docs/model-selection) to explore cost-effective model alternatives
- Check out more [Skills](/docs/core-concept/skills) to add new capabilities
- Experiment with your `AGENTS.md` to customize the output format
