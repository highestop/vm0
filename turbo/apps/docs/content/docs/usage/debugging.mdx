description: Debug agent runs with checkpoints and logs

After each run, VM0 outputs a **Checkpoint ID** that references a snapshot of the conversation and artifact at that moment.

## Resume from Checkpoint

Use `vm0 run resume` to go back to a snapshot point:

```bash
vm0 run resume <checkpoint-id> "try a different approach"
```

- Uses snapshotted conversation history
- Uses snapshotted artifact version
- Best for branching or trying alternatives

## Multi-Step Debugging

For complex workflows, you can debug step by step using checkpoints.

**Example: A 3-step workflow**

Step 1 - Run the first step:

```bash
vm0 run my-agent "do step 1" --artifact-name my-project
# Outputs: checkpoint-id-1
```

Step 2 - Check the results, then resume:

```bash
# View logs from step 1
vm0 logs <run-id-1>

# Check artifact state
vm0 artifact pull

# Resume to step 2
vm0 run resume <checkpoint-id-1> "do step 2"
# Outputs: checkpoint-id-2
```

Step 3 - Repeat:

```bash
# View logs from step 2
vm0 logs <run-id-2>

# Resume to step 3
vm0 run resume <checkpoint-id-2> "do step 3"
```

This approach lets you:

- Observe the agent's progress at each step
- Inspect logs and artifact state between steps
- Retry a step with different prompts if needed
- Branch from any checkpoint to try alternative approaches

## Viewing Logs

View full logs from a completed run:

```bash
vm0 logs <run-id>
```

View the last N lines:

```bash
vm0 logs <run-id> --tail 100
```

View the first N lines:

```bash
vm0 logs <run-id> --head 50
```
