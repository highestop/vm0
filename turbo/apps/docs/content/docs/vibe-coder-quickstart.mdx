title: Vibe Coder Quick Start
description: Get started with VM0 using Claude Code in minutes
---

If you use Claude Code and prefer a vibe-first approach to building agents, this guide is for you.

## Step 1: Initial Setup

Get started with a single guided command in your terminal (not Claude Code):

```bash
npm install -g @vm0/cli && vm0 onboard
```

The `vm0 onboard` command provides a complete interactive setup that:
1. Authenticates you with vm0.ai
2. Configures your model provider
3. Creates a new agent project directory
4. Installs the VM0 skill for Claude Code

## Step 2: Build Your First Agent

After onboarding completes, you can build agents directly in Claude Code:

```bash
cd my-vm0-agent && claude "/vm0-agent let's build an agent"
```

Continue the conversation in natural language and you'll complete creating and running your first agent.

## Step 3: Creating More Agents - Manage My Agents

After your initial onboarding, when you want to create a new agent or modify existing ones, you don't need to run `vm0 onboard` again. Simply install the VM0 skill in your project directory:

```bash
vm0 setup-claude
```

This enables the `/vm0-agent` and `/vm0-cli` commands in Claude Code, allowing you to build and manage agents directly.

By default, it installs at project scope (current directory only). Use `--scope user` to install globally for all your Claude Code projects.

**Examples of using the VM0 skill in Claude Code:**
```
/vm0-agent let's create another agent
/vm0-agent update my agent
/vm0-agent manage my schedule
```
